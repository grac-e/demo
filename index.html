                    <li>Richard is an NSFAS-funded student who shares an apartment with a roommate. He is often left
                        with little to spare after payday as most of his money goes towards rental fees due to a strict
                        landlord. He missed his last two WiFi payments and needs money to cover the WiFi cost for his
                        studies, so he decides to borrow money anonymously from Brian.</li>
                    <li>Brian is also an NSFAS-funded student with minimal expenses at the end of the month. He has
                        learned about a developing opportunity in the student-res space but requires some capital to
                        participate. Brian has joined Campus Coin hoping to earn interest as a lender.</li>

                        Our application is decentralised, allowing NSFAS to send stipends on time and all students can
                        have the money reflecting immediately, without having to wait for slow bank payments to reflect.

                        To ensure that Richard can borrow money quickly and easily when he needs it, and Brian is
                        guaranteed to get his money back with a little interest, our blockchain-based
                        application ensures that transactions are secure, transparent, and tamper-proof. The smart
                        contracts do not need a third-party’s consent, and ensure that Brian’s terms and conditions are
                        met before he borrows Richard money.

                    <li>Brian can now lend money on his own terms to Richard with a
                        guarantee that he will get it back, and with interest, while Richard now has financial support
                        that is more accessible to students like him.</li>
                    <li>Both guys can easily get a credit-scoring rating using their
                        day-to-day expenses, rather than conventional credit assessments.</li>
                    <li>In the future, we plan to integrate a machine learning model to provide more accurate credit
                        scoring based on spending patterns and repayment history, which would offer better risk
                        predictions and personalised lending terms. Additionally, our app aims to introduce an AI-driven
                        financial advising feature to offer tailored budgeting tips and financial guidance to students.
                        We also aim to have our application available on a global scale and adaptable to different
                        student-funding systems.</li>
