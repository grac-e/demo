                    <li>Richard is an NSFAS-funded student who shares an apartment with a roommate. He is often left
                        with little to spare after payday as most of his money goes towards rental fees due to a strict
                        landlord. He missed his last two WiFi payments and needs money to cover the WiFi cost for his
                        studies, so he decides to borrow money anonymously from Brian.</li>
                    <li>Brian is also an NSFAS-funded student with minimal expenses at the end of the month. He has
                        learned about a developing opportunity in the student-res space but requires some capital to
                        participate. Brian has joined Campus Coin hoping to earn interest as a lender.</li>

                        Our application is decentralised, allowing NSFAS to send stipends on time and all students can
                        have the money reflecting immediately, without having to wait for slow bank payments to reflect.

                        To ensure that Richard can borrow money quickly and easily when he needs it, and Brian is
                        guaranteed to get his money back with a little interest, we have built a blockchain-based
                        application that ensures that transactions are secure, transparent, and tamper-proof. The smart
                        contracts do not need a third-party’s consent, and ensure that Brian’s terms and conditions are
                        met before he borrows Richard money.
